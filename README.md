Mobile Application Development Course Project

We aim to provide the users with a user-friendly design and easy access to all the information to make their life more convenient.

There are two types of users, “Care Receiver” and “Care Giver or Other”.
All users are allowed to sign up an account, log in, manage user profile and manage user account.

Activities for Care Receiver:
View event 
Search event
Post comments under the event 
Search caregivers that are available and match with their schedule

Activities for Care Giver or Other:
Add the information about the caregivers
Post events and activities that are going to be organised
Edit, delete and update all the information about the events or activities
